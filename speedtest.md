# Why speedtest.net is almost meaningless

## How does speedtest.net work?
One of the most common tools measure network performance is iPerf3. 
The Speedtest webpage or App is basically an iPerf3 speedtest from your PC (or tablet or smartphone or whatever), to your modem/router, to some iPerf server in your ISPs core network. 
This looks something like this:

So the only thing you are measuring is the speed from you device to you router, how fast you router can handle traffic, and how fast your connection to some server in your ISPs network is.
